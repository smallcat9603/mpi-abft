# mpi-abft
This repo contains several algorithm based fault tolerant apps.
Each app contains an original version and a modified abft version (_abft).

- CRC32 is used to verify the integrity of communication data.
- Hamming code (SECDED) is used to correct one-bit errors and detect two-bit errors in data blocks. 

## MM
- Compile
```
$ make mm
$ make mm_abft
```
- Run
```
$ mpirun -np <num_of_procs> bin/mm <matrix_a_filename> <matrix_b_filename>
$ mpirun -np <num_of_procs> bin/mm_abft <matrix_a_filename> <matrix_b_filename>
```
A small program [gen_matrices.py](src/mm/gen_matrices.py) helps to generate a matrix.
